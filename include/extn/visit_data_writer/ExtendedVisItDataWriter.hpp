 * @brief Class ExtendedVisItDataWriter is used by SAMRAI-based application codes to generate VisIt
 * data files.  VisIt provides a wide range of visualization and post-processing capabilities.  This
 * class supports both cell-centered and node-centered 2D and 3D AMR data where the underlying data
 * type is either double, float, or int.  Scalar, vector and 2nd-order tensor variables are supported.
 * This class may be used when the mesh geometry is managed by a SAMRAI::geom::CartesianGridGeometry
 * object, or when the mesh itself is stored in a state variable to allow moving deformed grids.
 *
 * The extended VisIt data writer (VDW) supports CELL or NODE centered data of data type double,
 * float, and integer.  There is support to convert an alternative user-defined type into standard
 * cell or node centered data for visualization purposes.  See method descriptions below for more
 * information.  The data actually written by the VDW is of type float so data should not exceed the
 * defined MAX_FLT and/or MIN_FLT.  An optional scale factor may be supplied for data that exceeds
 * these values.
 *
 * After creating an extended VDW object, the data items to be dumped for plotting must be registered
 * with that object.  Thereafter, the object can be used to generate a series of visualization dump
 * files during the execution of an application.  The dumps will include all data items registered
 * with the VDW.
 *
 * This class supports the dumping of data that resides on an AMR patch hierarchy at the time the
 * dump file is written, and derived data, data that does not live on the patch hierarchy, but that
 * can be computed from data which does live on the patch hierarchy.  Derived data requires the user
 * to implement a method for a concrete class derived from the SAMRAI::appu::VisDerivedDataStrategy
 * abstract class.
 *
 * The class also supports writing material and species data.  Material is data which indicates for
 * each cell, the fractional amount of a material compound, e.g. "steel", "gas", "copper", etc.,
 * contained in that cell.  Species are subcomponents of a material, e.g. if the material is "gas",
 * it may have subcomponents such as "nitrogen", "oxygen", etc.  To use material data it is necessary
 * for a user to implement the relevant packing methods for a concrete class derived from the
 * SAMRAI::appu::VisMaterialsDataStrategy abstract class.
 *
 * The extended VDW requires the compilation with the HDF5 library.
 *
 *
 * A brief summary of the basic steps typically involved in using the extended VDW are:
 *
 *     -  Create an extended VisIt data writer object, specifying a name for the object and the name
 *        of the directory to contain the visit dump files.  An optional argument number_procs_per_file,
 *        applicable to parallel runs, sets the number of processors that share a common dump file.
 *        This can reduce parallel I/O contention. The default value of this arg is 1.  If the value
 *        specified is greater than the number of processors, then all processors share a single
 *        dump file.
 *
 *     - Register hierarchy variable data fields using registerPlotQuantity().  The variables
 *       registered may be scalar, vector, or tensor (depth 1, dim, and dim*dim, respectively) which
 *       is specified in the argument list.  All variables require a string identifier and an index
 *       into the patch data array on the AMR hierarchy. Optionally, a start depth index may be
 *       supplied to plot a single component of a multi-component field (i.e. a scalar quantity within
 *       a vector, or a vector within a tensor).  A scale factor may also optionally be specified.
 *       Lastly, for user-defined data that is not cell or node type, the proper centering (cell or
 *       node) for the data may be supplied.
 *
 *     - If using derived data, set a default user-defined derived data writer using
 *       setDefaultDerivedDataWriter().  A derived data writer may also optionally be specified in
 *       the call to registerDerivedPlotQuantity(); if so, this derived data writer will be used for
 *       the variable being registered.  If no derived writer is specified in the registration call,
 *       the default derived data writer will be used.
 *
 *     - Register derived variable data fields using registerDerivedPlotQuantity().  All derived
 *       variables require a string identifier. Optionally, a SAMRAI::appu::VisDerivedDataStrategy
 *       object, a scale factor, and centering and may be specified.  By default, the data is assumed
 *       to be cell-centered.
 *
 *     - The resetLevelPlotQuantity() method is provided for cases when a variable lives at different
 *       patch data indices on different levels.  Invoking this method redefines the patch data array
 *       index for a given variable on a given level that will be written to a visit dump file.  Before
 *       this method is called, the variable must be registered using registerPlotQuantity() method.
 *
 *     - If using deformed structured AMR grids (moving grids), register the coordinates of the nodes
 *       using the registerNodeCoordinates() method.
 *
 *     - If using materials, set the user-defined data writer for material data using
 *       setMaterialsDataWriter().  Then register the names of the materials being used with
 *       registerMaterialNames().
 *
 *     - If using species of the materials, register the names of the species of each material using
 *       the registerSpeciesNames() method.
 *
 *     - The writer will generate VisIt dump files when the method writePlotData() is called.
 *       Minimally, only a hierarchy and the time step number is needed.  A simulation time can also
 *       be specified which will be included as part of the file information in the dump
 *
 *     - The document "Generating VisIt Visualization Data Files in SAMRAI" in the SAMRAI documentation
 *       directory (docs/userdocs/VisIt-writer.pdf) gives in-depth details on the use of the VDW and
 *       materials, as well as example code fragments showing how the various ExtendedVisItDataWriter
 *       methods can be embedded in an application.

         * "registerMaterialNames()" method is called before this method.
         *
         * For each species name registered, there is an associated species
         * fraction,  which must be between 0 and 1.0 on each cell. The sum of
         * the species fractions for all species of a given material must
         * equal 1.0 in every cell in which that material appears.  In VisIt,
