 * @brief Class ExtendedRefineAlgorithm encapsulates the AMR communication pattern to refine data to,
 * copy data to, or fill physical boundary data on any destination patch level.
 *
 * The basic procedure for moving data follows three steps:
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li> interpolate data (spatial and possibly temporal) from coarser levels
 *    <li> copy data from the same level of refinement
 *    <li> fill physical boundary conditions regions
 * </ul>
 *
 * Each data communication procedure generally consists of three parts: an algorithm, a schedule, and
 * a patch strategy.  The algorithm describes the patch data components and time and space
 * interpolation operations, but is independent of the configuration of the patches in an AMR hierarchy.
 * Patch data items and their associated spatial and time interpolation operators are registered with
 * an instantiation of this algorithm class.  To generate the communication dependencies for a
 * particular patch hierarchy configuration, the algorithm creates a refine schedule based on the
 * state of a given hierarchy and the information in the algorithm.  The schedule can then perform
 * the communication operations that move data to the destination patch level using the associated
 * operators.  User-defined operations (such as filling physical boundaries and special interpolation
 * procedures) are provided through a refine patch strategy object.  User-defined interpolation
 * operations can be written using the interfaces in RefinePatchStrategy for preprocessRefine() and
 * postProcessRefine().
 *
 * In general, source data is copied into the designated scratch data for temporary processing.  The
 * scratch space must contain sufficient ghost cells to accommodate the stencil width of the given
 * interpolation operators and any physical boundary data that must be filled.  The scratch storage
 * is copied into the destination data space at the end of the communication process.  Thus, copy
 * operations between source, scratch, and destination patch data objects must be defined.
 *
 * In general, the destination and scratch data components may be the same (assuming that the scratch
 * component has a sufficient ghost cells width).  The source and scratch components SHOULD NOT be
 * the same, since the interiors of the source space could be changed by the use of the scratch
 * data as temporary work space.
 *
 * It is the user's responsibility to register valid operations with the refine algorithm so that
 * the data communication can occur.  In particular, communication operations (e.g., data refinement,
 * data copy, etc.) are performed in the order that items are registered for refinement with a refine
 * algorithm object.  Thus, order of registration must repect any dependencies among patch data
 * communicated.  Also, users who use the preprocessRefine() and postProcessRefine() operations in
 * the patch strategy object must make sure that all data that is needed in those operations are
 * registered with the ExtendedRefineAlgorithm using registerRefine() whether or not the data is to
 * be refined.
 *
 * Typical usage of a refine algorithm to perform inter-patch communication on an AMR hierarchy
 * involves four steps:
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li> Construct a refine algorithm object.
 *    <li> Register refine operations with the refine algorithm.  Using the registerRefine() methods(s),
 *         one provides source and destination patch data information, as well as time and space
 *         interpolation operators as needed.  Two registerRefine() methods appear in this class;
 *         one supports time interpolation, one does not.
 *    <li> After all operations are registered with the algorithm, one creates a communication
 *         schedule using one of the createSchedule() methods.  These methods are distinguished by
 *         the resulting data communication pattern (e.g., interpatch communication on a single level,
 *         between two different levels at the same grid resolution, interpolation of data between
 *         different AMR hierarchy levels, etc.) Note that when creating a communication schedule,
 *         a concrete instance of a RefinePatchStrategy object may be required to supply physical
 *         boundary conditions as well as user-defined spatial data interpolation operations.
 *    <li> Invoke the fillData() method in the communication schedule to perform the data transfers.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that each refine schedule created by a refine algorithm remains valid as long as the patches
 * involved in the communication process do not change; thus, they can be used for multiple data
 * communication cycles.

         * @brief Create a communication schedule that communicates data from a source level to a
         * destination level and interpolates data from coarser hierarchy levels where needed.
         *
         * Data will be communicated from the interiors of the source data on the source level to
         * the interiors and ghosts of destination data on the destination level where those sources
         * and destinations overlap.  Where they do not overlap, data will be interpolated from
         * source data on coarser levels in the patch hierarchy.
         *
         * Data is time interpolated between old and new sources on coarser levels when and where
         * time interpolation is needed and copied from the source components on the source level
         * into the destination components otherwise.
         *
         * This form of schedule construction is typically used after regridding (where the source
         * level is the patch level being replaced by the destination level in the patch hierarchy)
         * or when the data on destination patch level is to be overwritten by data interpolated
         * from coarser levels in the patch hierarchy.  In the first case, data on the destination
         * level will be copied from the source level in regions where those two levels overlap and
         * filled with interpolated values from the hierarchy elsewhere.  In the latter case, the
         * source level pointer may be null.  Then, data on the destination level will be filled
         * using interpolated data from coarser hierarchy levels.
         *
         * In certain rare cases in may be desired to perform time interpolation between old and new
         * sources onto the destination level.  In this case the optional argument
         * use_time_interpolation should be set to true. Regardless of the value of this argument,
         * time interpolation on coarser levels will always occur whenever needed.
         *
         * Note that when the source level pointer is non-null, the index spaces of the source and
         * destination levels must be aligned with one another.
         *
         * Note that the schedule remains valid as long as the levels involved in its creation do
         * not change; thus, it can be used for multiple data communication cycles.

         *                                    hierarchy levels.  When this pointer is not null, the
