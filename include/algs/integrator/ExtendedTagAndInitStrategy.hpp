/**
 * Class ExtendedTagAndInitStrategy is an abstract base class
 * that defines a Strategy pattern interface for concrete cell tagging
 * and level initialization operations that are needed by the
 * ExtendedTagAndInitialize class.  This base class insulates
 * that algorithm class from routines for initializing a new level in
 * the hierarchy and for tagging cells to be refined.  Generally, these
 * operations are specific to the problem being solved and the solution
 * methods being employed.  An object of this type is passed into the
 * ExtendedTagAndInitialize constructor.
 *
 * This base class has two pure virtual functions:
 * initializeLevelData(), and resetHierarchyConfiguration() that must
 * be implemented for any regridding method.  The first function sets
 * data on a new level after regridding.  The second function is called
 * at the end of the regridding process and can be used to set communication
 * schedules, for example, which depend on the configuration of the AMR
 * patch hierarchy.  Other routines are virtual here and given default
 * implementations as they are specific to only one type of error estimation
 * method. Value detector functionality requires an implementation of the
 * applyValueDetector() routine. Gradient detector functionality requires an
 * implementation of the applyGradientDetector() routine. Multiresolution
 * detector functionality requires an implementation of the
 * applyMultiresolutionDetector() routine. Integral detector functionality
 * requires an implementation of the applyIntegralDetector() routine. The
 * Richardson extrapolation method requires implementations of the methods:
 * applyRichardsonExtrapolation(), coarsenDataForRichardsonExtrapolation(),
 * getLevelDt(), advanceLevel(), resetTimeDependentData(), and
 * resetDataToPreadvanceState().
