/**
 * Class TimeRefinementIntegrator manages time integration over an
 * AMR patch hierarchy using local time refinement for finer hierarchy levels.
 * This class orchestrates hierarchy construction, data advancement and
 * synchronization, and the dynamic grid refinement processes.  The basic
 * ideas behind these algorithms are described in several sources on
 * structured adaptive mesh refinement.  See Berger and Colella, J. Comp.
 * Phys. (82)1:64-84, 1989 for an introduction to algorithm.  See Trangenstein,
 * SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 16(4):819-839, 1995, or Hornung, PhD thesis, Dept.
 * of Mathematics, Duke University, 1994 for further discussion.
 *
 * This class can be used in two different modes:  refined timestepping,
 * which divides they hierarchy's timestep into smaller timesteps on finer
 * levels, or synchronized timestepping, which advances all levels in a
 * hierarchy by the same timestep.  The mode that is used is determined
 * by querying the level integrator that is passed into the constructor.
 * One and only one mode can be used for each instantiation of
 * this class.
 *
 * The algorithm requires that integration steps on different levels are
 * interleaved since the time increment used on each level is determined
 * by the spatial resolution of the mesh on that level (e.g., CFL condition).
 * Generally, when using refined timestepping, coarser levels use larger time
 * increments than finer levels.  Thus, data must be synchronized between
 * levels and the dynamic regridding process must be coordinated with
 * the time stepping sequence.
 *
 * The routines in this class are implemented in a manner that is generic
 * with respect to the details of the level integration and regridding
 * methods, and the discrete equations being solved.  Thus, the class may
 * be employed for a variety of applications.  Upon construction, an object
 * of this class is configured with routines suitable for a given problem.
 * The algs::TimeRefinementLevelStrategy data member supplies routines
 * for advancing levels and synchronizing data on different levels during
 * time integration.  The mesh::GriddingAlgorithmStrategy data member provides
 * operations that construct and dynamically reconfigure the patch hierarchy.
 * The collaboration between this class and each of those objects follows
 * the Strategy design pattern.
 *
 * Initialization begins by setting data on the coarsest AMR hierarchy
 * level.  Then, each successively finer level is created and initialized
 * after invoking the regridding procedures on the most recently initialized
 * level.  This process is performed until either a maximum number of levels
 * is reached or no further refinement is needed.
 *
 * Time integration is performed by invoking a recursive advance procedure on
 * the coarsest AMR hierarchy level.  On a level, data is integrated to
 * a given point using a sequence of integration steps, where the size of
 * each time increment depends on the problem being solved.  After each
 * step on a level, the next finer level (if it exists) is integrated to
 * the same time using a sequence of time steps appropriate for the level.
 * This class may dynamically adjust the time step sequence used on each
 * level during the data advance process depending on requirements of the
 * integrator and information about stable time step size.  Dynamic
 * mesh regridding is invoked during the integration process so that
 * time integration, data synchronization, and mesh movement are coordinated
 * properly.
 *
 * <b> Input Parameters </b>
 *
 * <b> Definitions: </b>
 *    - \b    regrid_interval
 *       when using synchronized timestepping, number of timesteps between each
 *        regrid of the hierarchy
 *
 *    - \b    start_time
 *       start time for the simulation.
 *
 *    - \b    end_time
 *       end time for the simulation.
 *
 *    - \b    grow_dt
 *       maximum factor by which each succesive time increment may grow
 *       (typically >= 1.0).
 *
 *    - \b    max_integrator_steps
 *       maximum number of timesteps performed on the coarsest hierarchy level
 *       during the simulation.
 *
 *    - \b    tag_buffer
 *       array of integer values (one for each level that may be refined)
 *       representing the number of cells by which tagged cells are buffered
 *       before clustering into boxes.
 *
 * Note that the input values for regrid_interval, end_time, grow_dt,
 * max_integrator_steps, and tag_buffer override values read in from restart.
